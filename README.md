A simple CLI tool for performing basic file operations like reading, writing, and deleting files using Node.js.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Node.js installed.
2. Clone the repository.
3. Navigate to the project directory in the terminal.
4. Use the following commands:

   - Read a file: `node fileOperations.js read <filename>`
